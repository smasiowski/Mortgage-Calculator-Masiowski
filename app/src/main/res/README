Create an app that calculates a mortgage payment estimate based on input from the user.
Provide the user with the ability to input a home value, loan amount, interest rate, loan term,
start date, property tax, home insurance per year, and monthly HOA amount. Include an option to
calculate mortgage summary or an option for payment summary. The option can be however you want
to represent it, radio buttons, checkboxes, or just two different buttons. I would like that
whatever choice is made, that a new activity is launched with the appropriate calculations
made. ( HINT: three activities will be required). An example screenshot is provided as example
to help spark an idea for your project. Do not copy verbatim. Come up with your own UI design.
As with all of the projects, application state must maintained.

TODO:

Open Android Studio and create an Android project named Mortgage-calculator-<yourLastName>.
Create a README.md and put '#README' in it.
VCS -> Import into Version Control -> Share Project on GitHub. Use 'Initial Commit' as commit message.
Verify files were uploaded to your GitHub account.
Complete the project.
Add a 'screenshots' directory at the project's top level and place your screenshots in it.

When you are complete with your project, commit and push files to GitHub. VCS -> Commit Changes

Note: Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked
publically in Piazza. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see
someone has posted a question on Piazza and you know the answer, please chime in and answer.
This might seem rough at the beginning, but I promise it will get easier.
