 +## DUE: 09 Feb 2017
 +
 +## Instructions:
 +
 +Create an app that calculates a mortgage payment estimate based on input from the user.
 Provide the user with the ability to input a home value, loan amount, interest rate, loan term,
 start date, property tax, home insurance per year, and monthly HOA amount. Include an option to
 calculate mortgage summary or an option for payment summary. The option can be however you want
 to represent it, radio buttons, checkboxes, or just two different buttons. I would like that
 whatever choice is made, that a new activity is launched with the appropriate calculations made.
 ( HINT: three activities will be required). An example screenshot is provided as example to help
 spark an idea for your project. Do not copy verbatim. Come up with your own UI design. As with
 all of the projects, application state must maintained.
 +
 +### TODO:

 + ***Note:*** Any issues you have with either the GitHub steps or Java/Android questions should be asked publically in Piazza. If you have a question, chances are someone else does also. If you see someone has posted a question on Piazza and you know the answer, please chime in and answer. This might seem rough at the beginning, but I promise it will get easier.
